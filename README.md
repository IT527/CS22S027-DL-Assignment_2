There are two parts in the project "Image Classifier using CNN on iNaturalist dataset" , i.e. Part-A and Part-B. 


In Part-A of project, there is an implementation of a convolution neural network from scratch using Python. It is designed to be flexible, allowing adjustments to various parameters such as network architecture, batch_size, number of filters, kernel size, activation functions, and experiment tracking using wandb.
</br>
</br>
While, in Part-B, we finetune an already pre-defined model for our dataset. 
</br>
</br>
The respective two folders contain the python script along with other necessary files required and readme file for execution.

The sweep details for choosing the hyperparameters, runs, sample test prediction images, and related plots can be viewed at:
